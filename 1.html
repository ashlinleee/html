        Farewell green fields and happy groves.
        Where flocks have took delight;
        Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves
        The feet of angels bright;
        Unseen they pour blessing,
        And joy without ceasing,
        On each bud and blossom,
        And each sleeping bosom.
        ...
        And there the lions ruddy eyes,
        Shall flow with tears of gold:
        And pitying the tender cries,
        And walking round the fold:
        Saying: wrath by his meekness
        And by his health, sickness,
        Is driven away,
        From our immortal day.
        
        And now beside thee bleating lamb,
        I can lie down and sleep;
        Or think on him who bore thy name,
        Graze after thee and weep.
        For wash'd in lifes river,
        My bright mane for ever,
        Shall shine like the gold,
        As I guard o'er the fold</font></pre><br>
    <marquee><font color="lavender"> Night" is a poem in the illuminated 1789 collection Songs of Innocence by William Blake, later incorporated into the larger compilation Songs of Innocence and of Experience. "Night" speaks about the coming of evil when darkness arrives, as angels protect and keep the sheep from the impending dangers.</font></marquee>
